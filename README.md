## Introduction

#### 1. Create comprehensive end-to-end tests with Jest
To Verify the functionality of your entire application, to easily revalidate this functionality within seconds, and for continuous integration, you need end-to-end testing. In this course We are going to start with the basics of Test-Driven Development, touching on the different types, and moving on to particially write an end-to-end test for (mumbles) web service application, built with Node.js and MongoDB using Jest, testing the applocation workflow from beginning to end with a high code coverage. I am Uzzal Kumar Roy and experienced Software Engineer in building Scalable Distributed Software Systems that meets business needs in diverse industries. I am excited to welcome you to my course titled "Learning End-to-End Testing with Jest." Let's get started.

#### 2. Prerequisites and learning objectives
1. RestfulAPI
2. NodeJs
3. ExpressJs
4. MongoBD
5. Mongoose
6. ES6

- This course makes use of a RESTful Node.js Expres application.
Therefore, to make the most out of this course, you need to have practical experience
writing RESTful applications with Node.js and Express. If you're new to writing RESTful API
With Node.js and Express or need to review them, I recommend searching the library for courses On Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.
Experience with ES6 syntax is essential to follow along. I will use the ECMAScript 6 standard,
also know as ES6, throughout this course. If you are not familiar with ES6, we have a course to help.
Search the library for Switching to ES6 in Node.js in the library.
Our project template uses Mongoose ORM to save our retrieve data fro a mongoDB.
So, experience with mongoDB and Mongooses is essential. I am developing on Windows 10 and using Visual Studio Code as my code editor.
Feel fress to follow along on any operating system and code editor of your choice.
